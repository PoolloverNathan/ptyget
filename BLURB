ptyget is a universal pseudo-terminal interface. It is designed to be
used by any program that needs a pty.

ptyget can also serve as a wrapper to improve the behavior of existing
programs. For example, ``ptybandage telnet'' is like ``telnet'' but can
be put into a pipeline. ``nobuf grep'' is like ``grep'' but won't
block-buffer if it's redirected.

Previous pty-allocating programs---rlogind, telnetd, sshd, xterm,
screen, emacs, expect, etc.---have caused dozens of security problems.
There are two fundamental reasons for this. First, these programs are
installed setuid root so that they can allocate ptys; this turns every
little bug in hundreds of thousands of lines of code into a potential
security hole. Second, these programs are not careful enough to protect
the pty from access by other users.

ptyget solves both of these problems. All the privileged code is in one
tiny program. This program guarantees that one user can't touch another
user's pty.

ptyget is a complete rewrite of pty 4.0, my previous pty-allocating
package. pty 4.0's session management features have been split off into
a separate package, sess.

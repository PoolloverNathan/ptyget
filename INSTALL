Things you have to decide before starting:

* The ptyget home directory, normally /usr/local. Binaries will be
stored in /usr/local/bin; man pages will be installed in /usr/local/man.
(To change this directory, edit conf-home.h now.)

* Whether you want secure pty allocation. The default is yes; the ptyget
program will be setuid root and will guarantee that one user can't touch
another user's ptys. There are three situations where you will have to
change the default:

   (1) You do not have privileges on this machine, so you cannot install
       ptyget setuid root.

   (2) You are using an operating system where ptyget cannot guarantee
       security. ptyget.c will refuse to compile in this case.

   (3) You have other, non-setuid programs that need to allocate ptys.
       (In this case, your security is already toast.) If ptyget is
       installed setuid root, it will interfere with these programs,
       since it never changes slaves to mode 666.

(If you are in one of these situations, edit conf-secure.h now.)


How to install:

 1. Create the ptyget home directory, if it doesn't already exist:
       # mkdir /usr/local; chmod 755 /usr/local
 2. Compile the programs and format the man pages:
       # make
 3. Install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup
